# IAL Project 1: Data Structures and Algorithms

**Course:** Algorithms (IAL)  
**Language:** C  

## Project Description
This project involved implementing three data structures in C, focusing on linked lists and queues to explore foundational algorithms.

### 1. **Single-Linked List (`c201.c`)**
   - Implemented an abstract data type for a singly linked list with basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### 2. **Character Queue (`c203.c`)**
   - Implemented a character queue using an array, including functions for enqueuing, dequeuing, and managing the queue with circular indexing.

### 3. **Doubly-Linked List (`c206.c`)**
   - Developed a doubly linked list with operations for adding, removing, and accessing nodes in both forward and backward directions.

Each implementation adheres to specified function prototypes and constraints provided in header files.
